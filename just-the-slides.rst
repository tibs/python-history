An amble through some of Python's history
=========================================

*pointing out interesting landmarks as we go, because to do the whole thing
would take too long...*

  **amble** to walk at an easy pace, with no particular destination in mind

About this talk
===============

I cover, at least briefly, the major releases of Python (and 1.5.2), and also
things that were happening in the Python world around those times.

1991 to 2017 - that's 26 years...

Is it accurate?

Well, there's certainly a lot of information (and links in the notes), but
there are also many places where I'm using my own memory of events, which is
doubtless unreliable. So think of it as an informal history, at best.

----

Where Python came from
======================

* Named after Monty Python, not the snakes
* Inspired by ABC and Modula-3
* Meant to be *readable*
* Python 1.0 came out in 1994

  * Perl came out in 1987
  * Tcl came out in 1988, Tk round about the same time, although it was useful
    from about 1990
  * Java 1.0 came out in 1995

----

How I found Python
==================

I don't remember exactly when I first found Python, but my first dated
Python script is from 1994.

My background had been with BCPL, Fortran and C (and also Emacs and
TeX/LaTeX, which will become relevant later on).

When I came across Python, I fell in love with it.

----

Why I like Python
=================
* runnable pseudo-code - especially the significant indentation
* dictionaries all the way down - high level datastructures built in
* exposes its innards - very unusually for a programming language, it allows
  itself to be modified - at least two implementations of goto (!) and Hy
* "safe"/"sane" - a sensible language written and designed by sensible people

----

.. A marker to make it obvious which slides represent a whole year.
.. I'm (perhaps) chancing it a bit for portability by using direct embedding
.. of a Unicode character. The blue circle ðŸ”µ is U+1F535

.. |year| unicode:: U+1F535

-26..-24 |year| Before 1994
=============================

Python **0.9.0** in 1991, followed by a flurry of other versions (not all
released), leading up to **0.9.8** in 1993

----

Before 1994: Feb 1991 Python 0.9.1p1
------------------------------------

* no ``__init__`` method
* no double quoted strings

* ``continue``
* ``{key: value}`` to define a dictionary
* blank and comment lines don't need to be correctly indented
* ``1 == 1.0``
* ``.pyc`` files; first ``pythonmode.el``

----

Before 1994: 1991 Python 0.9.3

*Again, probably not very released*

* ``global`` statement
* ``class B`` allowed, instead of ``class B()``, and can do ``class B(D``
* C shifting and masking operators (``<<``, etc)

* class attributes are no long read-only

----

Before 1994: Dec 1991 Python 0.9.4alpha
---------------------------------------

* new exceptions

* functions are called with 0..N arguments, not just 0 or 1.

    ``def init(self, (x, y))`` becomes ``def init(self, x, y)``

* ``x[-1]`` is equivalent to ``x[len(x)-1]``

----

Before 1994: Python 0.9.8
-------------------------

* number of arguments to a function must match number declared
* ``*args`` introduced to allow "varargs"
* ``sys.exitfunc`` called on exit, SIGTERM or SIGHUP
* I/O mostly accepts any object supporting ``readline()`` or ``write()``
* ``str()`` and ``repr()``
* ``cmp(x,y)``
* modules struct, fcntl, md5
* and from 0.9.7beta, ``__getitem__`` and ``__repr__``

----

-19 |year| 1998
===============

**Stackless Python** started

**Zope** released as free software

----

Stackless Python
----------------

Stackless Python, by Christian Tismer, was a set of modification for CPython
to provide true continuations, replaced later on with tasklets.

It eventually led to the greenlets module, and is an important precursor to
PyPy.

----

Zope
----

Zope was the killer Python app that never quite became so. But it's important
in various ways:

* it's the origin of structuredText, the predecessor to reStructuredText
* it was (one of) the first companies to open source its product as a result
  of commercial advice
* it was an early non-relational database (ZODB persists Python objects)
* the Zope web interface is to Python objects
* it's still around - Pylons, Zope 2, Blue Bream (aka Zope 3)
