An amble through the history of Python
======================================

An amble through some of Python's history, pointing out interesting landmarks
as we go, because to do the whole thing would take too long.

Maybe restrict to Python 2?

Timeline

Difficult to say exactly when I started using Python - the earlies piece of my
code with a date on it that I've found is from 1994.

* PyConUK 2014, keynote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI_RPSbsRw8,
  A time traveler's guide to Python, Jessica McKellar

* Monty Python, not snakes (and Guido's reluctance to see snakes associated
  with the language)
* Early web browser written in Python
* the Usenet days - back when you could read all of comp.lang.python every day
* Starship Python
* the Zen of Python, Guido's time machine, the PSF, and other jokes
* Guido - release a new version and go on holiday
* Tim Peters and timsort
* Python, Perl, Parrot

  * Fake Parrot interview: http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/04/01/parrot.htm
  * https://github.com/parrot is the real project
 
  From video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ4duC-V6Xw&feature=youtu.be

* Matz and Ruby
* tkinter, and why
* dictionaries all the way down
* doc strings
* Zope
* reStructuredText, docutils and David Goodger
* the doc-sig and approaches to typing in the docstring or comments
* sphynx, and the conversion of the Python docs to reStructuredText
* jpython/Jython, IronPython, PyPy and so on (and Stackless Python)
* 1.3 -> 1.5.2
* the story of 2.0 and Python licenses (and where Guido worked)
* PEPs, and the importance of being able to implement experimental things *in*
  Python, because its insides are so exposed
* decorators - their introduction without a special syntax, the long
  discussion on that syntax
* the with clause
* the history that led to "a = b if c else d"

  - Andrew Dalke resurrected Python 0.9.1 (And very primitive it is too. No
    copyright message when it starts up. Bad error reporting. Class delaration
    requires a () even when there are no parents. There's no __init__ special
    method, so the convention is to call 'Create()' yourself. Uses 'self' and
    'this' and other terms instead of only 'self'. Only understands 'single
    quote strings' and not "double quotes." )
