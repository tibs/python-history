Notes to be incorporated into the timeline
==========================================

Difficult to say exactly when I started using Python - the earlies piece of my
code with a date on it that I've found is from 1994.

The first PyCon

The first PyConUK

The start of CamPUG


* Monty Python, not snakes (and Guido's reluctance to see snakes associated
  with the language)


* Starship Python


* tkinter, and why
* dictionaries all the way down
* doc strings
* Zope
* reStructuredText, docutils and David Goodger
* the doc-sig and approaches to typing in the docstring or comments
* sphynx, and the conversion of the Python docs to reStructuredText
* jpython/Jython, IronPython, PyPy and so on (and Stackless Python)
* the story of 2.0 and Python licenses (and where Guido worked)
* PEPs, and the importance of being able to implement experimental things *in*
  Python, because its insides are so exposed
* decorators - their introduction without a special syntax, the long
  discussion on that syntax
* the with clause
* the history that led to "a = b if c else d"
